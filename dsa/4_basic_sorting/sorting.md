Certainly! Here's a quick overview of what happens in each sorting algorithm:

### Selection Sort
**Process:**
1. **Find the minimum element**: From the unsorted portion of the array, find the minimum element.
2. **Swap**: Swap this minimum element with the first unsorted element.
3. **Repeat**: Move the boundary of the sorted portion one element to the right.
4. **In short**:-we consider first element as minimum and store its index than compare it with the rest of the element in inner loop after comparing if mini index and the current ith index is not similar we swap

**Key Points:**
- Inefficient for large lists: \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Not stable (relative order of equal elements may change).

**Example:**
Given array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- Find the minimum element (11) and swap with 64: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`
- Find the next minimum element (12) and swap with 25: `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`
- Continue the process...

### Bubble Sort
**Process:**
1. **Compare and Swap**: Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Bubble Up**: The largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process for the rest of the elements.
4. **In short**:-we just compare the adjacent element and swap until it reaches the second half that is sorted part hence in this we start loop from i=n-1 to i>=0; than in inner loop we just compare from 0 th index to j < i and we are done

**Key Points:**
- Inefficient for large lists: \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- Simple to implement.
- Stable sorting algorithm.

**Example:**
Given array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- Compare 64 and 25, swap: `[25, 64, 12, 22, 11]`
- Compare 64 and 12, swap: `[25, 12, 64, 22, 11]`
- Continue the process...

### Insertion Sort
**Process:**
1. **Start with the second element**: Consider the first element as sorted.
2. **Insert**: Pick the next element and insert it into the correct position in the sorted portion.
3. **Repeat**: Continue until all elements are sorted.
4. **In short**:-consider the left part as sorted start from index 1 and than try to insert the element at index i th to the left sorted part in sorted manner for that consider j=i-1 and check j>=0 and if arr[j] is > key (current element) shift all element in left sorted part by 1 untill arr[j] > key it will be like arr[j+1] = arr[j] than after the loop just assign the key to arr[j+1] which is its real place since arr[j] is no longer bigger than key

**Key Points:**
- Efficient for small lists or nearly sorted lists: \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- Simple and intuitive.
- Stable sorting algorithm.

**Example:**
Given array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- Start with 25, insert it into the sorted portion: `[25, 64, 12, 22, 11]`
- Pick 12, insert it: `[12, 25, 64, 22, 11]`
- Continue the process...

### Merge Sort
**Process:**
1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.
3. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves back together.
4. **In short**: will have to find the mid and divide the array into two half that is left and right will call the mergesort again on these halfs when base case is reached that is when low >= high will start merging the arrays using merge in which will compare the element from left and righ array and store it in temp array and add remaining element if any
than will assign those sorted value to real array using the real index that is low and high

**Key Points:**
- Efficient for large lists: \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity.
- Requires additional space for merging.
- Stable sorting algorithm.

**Example:**
Given array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- Divide into `[64, 25, 12]` and `[22, 11]`
- Recursively sort each half.
- Merge the sorted halves.

### Quick Sort
**Process:**
1. **Pivot**: Choose a pivot element.
2. **Partition**: Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater than the pivot come after it.
3. **Recursively Sort**: Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning.
4. **In shorts**: 
consider a element suppose the last element as pivot
so will call partition on this
than we get a index which is at its correct position
now we just have to call the recursively for other remaing array
so call again quicksort(arr,low,pivotindex-1) and quicksort(arr,pivotindex+1,high) they will do thier work and arrang the pivot element to its correct position

now about partion function 
consider the pivot as high than consider a position_of_pivot as low-1 for now 
now traverse till high-1 and check if arr[j] < pivot than swap arr[j] with ++position_of_pivot 
in this way our position_of_pivot index will come where all the4 elements in its left is smaller than the pivot 
now swap the last position_of_pivot +1 with the pivot that is arr[high]

**Key Points:**
- Efficient for large lists: \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity on average.
- No additional space required (in-place).
- Not stable (relative order of equal elements may change).

**Example:**
Given array: `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`
- Choose pivot (e.g., 11)
- Partition around 11: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`
- Recursively sort the sub-arrays.

Here's a quick summary table for comparison:

| Quick Sort     | \(O(n \log n)\) / \(O(n^2)\)    | \(O(\log n)\)    | No        | General-purpose, large datasets             |

Each sorting algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different situations.
