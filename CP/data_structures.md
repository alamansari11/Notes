### Data Structures

**Introduction:**

**Data:**
Any piece of information is called data.

**Data Types:**
There are three data types:
1. Char
2. Int
3. Float

**Data Structures:**
Data structures involve the organization, management, and storage format of data for efficient access and modification.

**Abstract Data Type (ADT):**
An abstract data type is a type for an object whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. It only mentions what operations are to be performed, not how the operations are implemented or how it is organized in memory, or what algorithm will be used to implement that operation. It is called abstract because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of showing only the essential information and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

**Program:**
A program is a set of instructions to solve problems.
