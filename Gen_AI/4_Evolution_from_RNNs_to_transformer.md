# Evolution from RNNs to Transformers

## Generative Algorithms: Evolution

- **Historical Perspective**:
    - Previous generations: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
    - RNNs were powerful but limited by compute and memory constraints for generative tasks.

## Limitations of RNNs

- **Next-Word Prediction Task**:
    - Example of RNN's performance in next-word prediction task.
    - Limited context leads to poor predictions.
    - Scaling resources doesn't significantly improve prediction accuracy.

## Understanding Language Complexity

- **Contextual Understanding**:
    - Language comprehension requires understanding entire sentences or documents.
    - Homonyms and syntactic ambiguity challenge accurate prediction.

## Arrival of Transformer Architecture

- **Transformational Moment**:
    - Publication of "Attention is All You Need" (2017) by Google and University of Toronto.
    - Introduction of Transformer architecture revolutionized generative AI.

## Advantages of Transformer

- **Efficiency and Scalability**:
    - Efficiently utilizes multi-core GPUs.
    - Parallel processing of input data with larger training datasets.
- **Attention Mechanism**:
    - Learns to focus on the meaning of words through attention mechanism.
- **Key Insight**: "Attention is all you need" encapsulates the transformative potential of attention-based architectures.

The advent of the Transformer architecture marked a significant leap forward in generative AI, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches and unlocking new possibilities for language understanding and generation. Let's delve deeper into the transformative impact of attention mechanisms in the next section.
