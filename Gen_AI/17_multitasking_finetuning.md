# Multitask Fine-tuning and Further Fine-tuning

## Multitask Fine-tuning

- **Definition**:
  - Extension of single task fine-tuning using a dataset with examples for multiple tasks.
- **Dataset Composition**:
  - Includes examples for various tasks like summarization, review rating, code translation, and entity recognition.
- **Objective**:
  - Enhance model performance across multiple tasks simultaneously to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
- **Data Requirement**:
  - Substantial amount of data (50-100,000 examples) across multiple tasks.

## FLAN Family of Models

- **Introduction**:
  - FLAN (Fine-tuned Language Net) models are trained using multitask instruction fine-tuning.
- **Variants**:
  - FLAN-T5: Based on the T5 foundation model.
  - FLAN-PALM: Based on the PALM foundation model.
- **Training Data**:
  - Fine-tuned on 473 datasets across 146 task categories.

## Further Fine-tuning for Specific Use Cases

- **Scenario**:
  - Example: Data scientist building a customer service app.
- **Customization Requirement**:
  - Need for specialized summarization model for customer service chat conversations.
- **Approach**:
  - Further fine-tuning FLAN-T5 using domain-specific summarization dataset like dialogsum.
- **Dialogsum Dataset**:
  - Consists of over 13,000 support chat dialogues and summaries.
- **Fine-tuning Process**:
  - Improves FLAN-T5's ability to summarize support chat conversations.
  
## Evaluation of Fine-tuned Models

- **Quality Assessment**:
  - Comparison of model completions with human-produced summaries.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Metrics and benchmarks to assess model performance and improvement over base model.
- **Practical Application**:
  - Lab exercise to demonstrate fine-tuning and evaluation process.

## Conclusion
