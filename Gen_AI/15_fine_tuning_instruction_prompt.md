- **Data Splitting**:
  - Divide dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Compare LLM completions with expected responses from training data.
  - Calculate loss using crossentropy function for backpropagation.
- **Iterative Training**:
  - Update model weights over multiple epochs to enhance task performance.

### 3. Evaluation and Model Improvement
