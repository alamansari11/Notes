# Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) and Other Benchmarks

## Introduction

- **Complexity of LLM Evaluation**:
  - Simple metrics like ROUGE and BLEU provide limited insights.
- **Need for Holistic Evaluation**:
  - Utilize pre-existing datasets and benchmarks for comprehensive model assessment.

## Selecting Evaluation Datasets

- **Considerations**:
  - Isolate specific model skills (e.g., reasoning, common sense).
  - Focus on potential risks (e.g., disinformation, copyright infringement).
- **Importance of Unseen Data**:
  - Evaluate model performance on data unseen during training for accurate assessment.

## Key Benchmarks

### 1. GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)

- **Introduction**:
  - Collection of natural language tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, question-answering).
- **Purpose**:
  - Encourage model development for generalizing across multiple tasks.
- **Usage**:
  - Measure and compare model performance.

### 2. SuperGLUE

- **Introduction**:
  - Successor to GLUE, introduced in 2019.
- **Tasks**:
  - Includes more challenging versions of tasks and new tasks like multi-sentence reasoning.
- **Leaderboards**:
  - Allows comparison and contrast of evaluated models.

### 3. Other Significant Benchmarks

- **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**:
  - Tests models on extensive world knowledge and problem-solving across various domains.
- **BIG-bench**:
  - Consists of 204 tasks across diverse domains like linguistics, math, common sense reasoning, etc.
- **Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM)**:
  - Aims to improve transparency and offer guidance on model performance.
  - Utilizes multimetric approach across 16 core scenarios, including fairness, bias, and toxicity metrics.
  - Evolving benchmark with continuous addition of new scenarios, metrics, and models.

## Conclusion

- **Significance of Benchmarks**:
  - Provide comprehensive assessment of LLM capabilities.
- **HELM Framework**:
  - Focuses on transparency and measures beyond basic accuracy.
- **Continuous Evolution**:
  - Benchmarks evolve to adapt to the changing landscape of LLMs and their potential risks.
- **Application**:
  - Browse evaluation results to identify models suitable for specific project needs.
