# Evaluation Metrics for Language Models

## Introduction

- **Purpose**:
  - Understanding and formalizing performance improvement of fine-tuned models.
  - Exploring evaluation metrics used by developers to assess model performance.

## Challenges in Language Model Evaluation

- **Non-deterministic Output**:
  - Unlike traditional ML models, language models produce non-deterministic output.
- **Language-based Evaluation**:
  - Language structure complexity makes evaluation challenging.

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

- **Purpose**:
  - Assess quality of automatically generated summaries compared to human-generated ones.
- **Terminology**:
  - Unigram: Single word.
  - Bigram: Pair of words.
  - N-gram: Group of n words.
- **Metrics**:
  - ROUGE-1: Unigram matches.
  - ROUGE-2: Bigram matches.
  - ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence.

### 2. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

- **Purpose**:
  - Evaluate quality of machine-translated text.
- **Calculation**:
  - Average precision across multiple n-gram sizes.
- **Scoring**:
  - Closer to 1 indicates higher similarity to reference translation.

## Usage and Considerations

- **Implementation**:
  - Available in libraries like Hugging Face.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Simple metrics, useful for iterative model refinement.
  - Not sole indicators for final model evaluation.
- **Task-specific Evaluation**:
  - ROUGE for summarization tasks.
  - BLEU for translation tasks.
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Essential for comprehensive model evaluation.

## Conclusion

- **Role of Metrics**:
  - Formalizing performance improvement of fine-tuned models.
- **Application**:
  - Use in diagnostic evaluation during model iteration.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Explore evaluation benchmarks for overall model performance assessment.
